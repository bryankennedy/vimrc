# Instalation
1. Clone this repo wherever you'd like to keep your vimrc files. I keep mine in a folder called `~/.dotfiles` along with a bunch of other stuff.
        git clone git://github.com/bryankennedy/vimrc.git ~/.dotfiles/vimrc
2. Change directories to the `vimrc` folder.
        cd ~/.dotfiles/vimrc
3. Run the install script, telling it where you have install the vimrc folder
        ./install.sh ~/.dotfiles/vimrc
